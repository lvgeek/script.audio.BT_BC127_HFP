# script.audio.BT_BC127_HFP
This is an XBMC addon providing XBMC connection to BC127 Bluetooth interface 

I am developing this to work with my RPI based carpc based on http://www.engineering-diy.blogspot.ro/ system. 
I am integrating the SparkFun Jamboree Board based on the BC127 Bluetooth module.
Plan is a C++ controller running after startup that provides a socket server with kodi integration of BC127.
for this addon to interface with.
